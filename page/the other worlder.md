Maybe time travel or parallel world travel occurred, and people from a much safer, more utopia esque (but realistically so) world.time.timeline are encountering our current timeline in 2023

They are learning with the guide of people from OUR 2023 as allies, about our world. They go to the hospital, a school, or sporting event and encounter the metal detectors that all people walk through.

They ask first -- what is that? As it looks strange scary and managed by men with weapons and security outfit. Indicates the threat-detection quality of **THEOTHERWORLDER** by sensation perception and meaning-making of those symbols. 
"Is this a dangerous place?" They asked. The question was firstly about the STADIUM, SCHOOL, HOSPITAL, BUILDING  -- but both the OTHER WORLDER and WORLDER recognized the question applied too, about THIS WORLD. 

**The Other WORLDER** noticed their physical body responding to their SENSING PERCEIVING INTERPRETING, quickened heart rate, increased motion in gait, etc. They noticed an emotional cloud had built as leftovers from this uncertainty and awareness of threat.

"It's just a metal detector. Pretty standard at places like this. They're to keep everyone inside safe."

*They're meant to MANAGE threat... they are not the threat itself... Odd that the thing meant to keep people safe provoked feelings of unsafety and threat.* TheOtherWorlder thought. *Yet all of these people... seem to not be bothered at all by it. Moving through the process with familiarity, ease, in a procedural fashion. 

"This is common." She noted aloud, synthesizing the procedural familiarity she observed in the the throngs of people. 

"More common in the last 20 years or so... but yeah. Fairly standard when they are big crowds all together."
She still needed more information. Hearing the beeps and seeing the colored lights flash green.

She felt alarmed, the change in sound/color after successive green BINGs meant there was a violation. She observed that no one else in the line seemed to notice or react to this abrupt violation. There was no cause for alarm among the people.

*They are detached from the process and procedure they are within. They fully trust the operators, but as a whole do not trust each other. Authority means a great deal here, it communicates trust to people...* 

"What does it do? Does the archway indicate those with violent aggressive temperaments, or scan them for previous accounts of violence?" "Does it neutralize the aggressive energies, disrupt the auric problems?"

"No no no. what! No. nothing crazy like that! Its checking for weapons."

*These WORLDERs do not have trust in one another. Everyone here is first seen as a potential threat to not only the individual, but the group as a whole.* 

Still alarmed by the variation, she observed the security guard and patrons behavior. He paused, unlike the green lit people who walked on without a beat. He paused and turned around, waiting to be directed by the guard. They shared a glance, then he smiled, he was taking something out of his pocket.
Her heart raced. Her body froze. *Was this the threat they were detecting? What will he take out of his pocket. Is there harm about to occur?*

The man revealed a PHONE KEYS EYEGLASSES COINS. 


"Is a phone a weapon?" Again the question had dual meaning. To clarify the reason the phone was a RED and thus, a weapon... but also allowed through the bins.. And also.. .asking in general if these strange devices were, themselves dangerous to individuals and groups. 

Without hesitation he handed it directly to the guard. The guard nodded and placed it in one of the bins, onto a conveyer belt. The man knew what to do, but followed the timing of the guard nods and head directions (giving directions with nod to the left). The man walked back through, and through.

"No, it's a metal detector. Detects metal. That's what weapons are made of. "

She pondered this simplification of weapons and violence to metals...safety can be compromised without guns and knives... recognizing the social group management psychology at play. A simple clear declaration of safety. Metal Detectors Keep Weapons Out. There Are No Weapons Here. You Are Safe. It seems to have worked, as no one was bothered by the process, a routine and familiar one. 

It also applied to everyone. The individuals that were disabled, elderly, mothers ranging their young children. To Children. A child... would not be intent of disruption and aggression towards this crowd. They have to scan everyone. Treat everyone the same.

*There was broken trust for these groups. A falsity, an ill actor pretending to be someone appearing innocent, who harmed people. They have to check everyone now." 

"Put your phone and any metal objects... well magnetic ones I guess.. into that little bin." Then follow their guide to walk through the detector." WORLDER explained. 

"Will it cause any ill effects, the metal detection archway? Are they scanning my computab ... erm.. phone... for information?"

*She realized now, that she was lacking trust. Trust of the system of governance and management of society. Where did that come from all of a sudden* 

"It's fine. If it caused problems for us, they wouldn't use them. Someone would have seen to that." 

*Trust.. again in such interesting places and people. People they don't know if they even exist. Trust in truth from authority. While reminding the people that they cannot trust one another. * 










> "Social control and procedural justice theories indicate that informal social control reduces problem behaviors. However, many schools have implemented formal control mechanisms such as school security measures. This study examines the association between school security measures (security personnel, metal detectors, and surveillance cameras) and students' perceptions of informal social control (relationships with teachers, other school adults, and the fairness and consistency of school rules). We used structural equation modeling to examine these relationships in a nationally representative sample of 6,547 secondary students surveyed as part of the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (M age = 14.94; 51% male, 60% White non-Hispanic, 14% Black non-Hispanic, 20% Hispanic). The results indicated that the presence of security personnel in schools was associated with poorer student relationships with teachers. Findings for the other school security measures were nonsignificant or inconsistent across models. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."

> "This article argues that metal detectors bestow an organizational stigma to schools. One symptom of this is students' heightened level of fear at school. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and a matched-pair design, this study finds that metal detectors are negatively correlated with students' sense of safety at school, net of the level of violence at school. However, this association is different for urban students. The negative association between metal detectors and urban students' sense of safety is 13% less than what it is for students attending suburban or rural schools."
