<p>We know that in it are five main centers:<br />
1) thinking center <br />
2) formulatory apparatus<br />
3) emotional center<br />
4) moving <br />
5) sex centers. <br />
The one-sided development of any one of them leads to hypertrophy, the type of a one-centered man. </p>

<li>cycle of 1-9 </li>
<li>I can only mention the system of the great symbols called &#8220;Tarot&#8221;, and the symbols of magic, astrology and alchemy, each of which represents a symbolical system, that is, the path leading to a knowledge of the truth of unity. </li>

<p>The circle is divided into five different parts, six points connected by a figure which is symmetrical in relation to the diameter, passing through the top point of division and the center of the circle, and which is drawn as they say, with one stroke of the pen. <br />
Furthermore, the top point of division is the apex of a regular triangle connecting up the points of division on the complicated figure. This symbol will not be met with in the study of occultism, either in books or in the oral tradition. Such tremendous significance is attached to it by those who know that it has never at any time or at any place been published or communicated in entirety. <br />
But allusions to it are found even in occult literature. <em>For certain reasons I shall not say where, but you may come across such a translation of this very symbol;</em>  <strong>&#8220;double binary of the ternaries, taken in pairs, giving the quaternary is neutralized into an elongated pentagram by the big free ternary&#8221;.</strong> And this is formed as follows: <br> </p>

<p>When it was a question here of applying the laws of the octaves to the structure of the chemical elements, every substance derived on the basis of laws was symbolically termed a &#8220;hydrogen&#8221; of various gradations of density and other qualities which went to define it as a substance. <br>By the law of the 3, it was built up from active, passive, and neutral substances correspondingly termed &#8220;oxygen&#8221;, &#8220;carbon&#8221;, and &#8220;azote&#8221; (or &#8220;nitrogen&#8221;), that is, the following structure was obtained: <br>C+O+ N > H </p>
